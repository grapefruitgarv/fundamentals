To start this off, pull up your terminal and let's get after it! If you
already have a Virtual Machine installed, feel free to use that. If you
don't have VM installed, or don't know what that is, don't worry, we
will get to it!

Visit this online shell: <https://www.hoppersroppers.org/shell/> 

First command we are going to type will tell us who we are, which is
clearly a badass.

``` default
$ whoami
```

The next command will tell us our path within directory, also known as
our working directory. On Linux, we call folders directories because it
sounds cooler, don't get thrown off.

``` default
$ pwd
```

Lets print out the long names of everything in our current working
directory with `ls -l`. The -l is a flag that tells ls to print the
"long" file information.

``` default
$ ls -l
```

This showed everything in our directory. Now let's go make a new
directory inside this one to play in.

``` default
$ mkdir linuxPlayground
```

To enter this newly created directory, use the "change directory"
command. Instead of typing out all of "linuxPlayground" use bash's
autocomplete feature by pressing tab once you have a few characters
typed, then press enter. This is super helpful, you can use autocomplete
for basically anything.

``` default
$ cd linuxPlayground
```

Check where you are with `pwd`.

List out the files in this new directory with `ls -l`. Unsurprisingly,
it's empty.

To get back to the previous directory, type the command.

``` default
$ cd ..
```

The ".." is a strange concept but basically means "go up one level". If
you wanted to go up two levels, you would type `cd ../..`

Alright, `cd` back into the linuxPlayground directory.

Once you are in there, let's print something to the terminal.

``` default
$ echo Hello World!
```

This is nice, but now let's save it to a new file.

``` default
$ echo Hello World! > file1.txt
```

That arrow is known as a redirector and can be used to redirect the
output of commands to files.

Now use `ls` to check how many files there are, you should see file1.

Use the new command `cat` to read the contents of file1. Use the tab
autocomplete so you don't have to type the whole thing.

``` default
$ cat file1.txt
```

Sweeeeet. We're starting to go somewhere.

Now let's append (that means add to the back of) file1.

``` default
$ echo Goodbye! >> file1.txt
```

As a note, we used two redirectors there. If we only use one it overwrites
the file, but two redirectors tells the bash shell to append to the back
of an existing file.

Use `cat` to read file1. What do you see?

Lets now make a copy of file1.

``` default
$ cp file1.txt file2.txt
```

Use `ls` to print out all files in your directory , then `cat` file2.
Now use `mkdir` to make a new folder named folder1. We'll save this for
later.

Now let's learn how to delete file1.

``` default
$ rm file1
```

Use `ls -l` and voila! file1 is gone! (you should also see folder1 now)

While you have the results of `ls -l` up, look at what information is
being shown for file2.

The output of `ls -l` should look like this:

``` default
drwxr-x--- 2 username groupname 4096 Jan 21 14:02 folder1 
-rwxr-x--- 1 username groupname 15 Jan 21 14:02 file2
```

We won't beat this up too hard for now, but know that we can see:

-   The first bit tells us what type of file it is
    -   "d" means directory
    -   "-" means normal file
    -   There are more options that can go here, but it doesn't matter
        for Now
-   The next 9 bits are permissions bits
    -   You will learn more later, but they follow the
        read/write/execute format for the file owner/group/and others
    -   You don't really know what that means, so don't worry for now
-   The next bit, a number, tells us how many hard links there are to
    the file, but don't worry about it
-   The first name is the username who owns the file, in this case you
-   The second name is the group who owns the file. Unless you've setup
    a group already, this should also be your username
-   The next number is the file size in bytes
    -   Directories are always 4096, but individual files should be the
        number of bytes that make them up
-   The next numbers should be the date and time last modified. These
    are not forensically accurate, but are good enough to sort by
    timestamp.
-   Finally, the name of the file you are looking at the details of.

Okay that was a bit, don't worry too much about permissions and links
and groups, but refer back to this when you have questions, or just
Google "what does ls -l show"... you'll probably get a better
description than mine!

Back to the command line!!!!!

Run the `touch` command to update the timestamp on file2.

``` default
$ touch file2.txt
```

Use `ls -l` to verify the timestamp was updated.

Touch also has the ability to make a new empty file with the timestamp
set for now.

``` default
$ touch file3.txt
```

Use `ls -l` to verify the new file exists.

We will use the command `mv` to move file3 into folder1.

Use `ls -l` to verify the folder was created.

``` default
$ mv file3.txt folder1/
```

Use `cd` into folder1 and use `ls` to verify file3 is in there.

Alright, now let's delete folder1. Before trying to delete folder1, make
sure you are actually in the correct path! If you are in folder1, the rm
command won't be able to find folder1!  
  
Use $ cd .. to go back up the directory tree one step.

You can try to use `rm folder1` but it will tell you that folder1 is a
directory. To delete it, use the "-r" flag, for recursive. 

`rm -r folder1` will delete everything in folder1 recursively, including
other folders underneath. This is a dangerous command as you can
accidentally delete things with it if you `rm -r` the wrong directory.
`rm` is unforgiving, if you delete with it, the files are gone and will
not be saved in Ubuntu's Trash. Sure the file might still be on your
hard drive, but you're probably not good enough for recovering that yet
(we do that later in the course though!). `rm` is often referred to as a
"footgun" in the nerd community, as you probably will shoot yourself in
the foot with it at some point.

Alright, that was a lot. We learned a ton of commands, and you're
probably a bit stressed right now about what didn't make sense to you.

Use the command `history` to pull up your most recent commands and leave
them on the screen.

Then work through it and take notes on what you still don't understand
about what was described in this section. Submit anything you are
confused about.
